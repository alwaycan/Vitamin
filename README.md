* VB1 Introduction *
Vitamin B1 belongs to the B group of vitamins, is one of the 13 essential vitamins in the human body, in the form of coenzyme to participate in carbohydrate catabolism. Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, antineuritis, also known as anti-neuritis factor or anti-beriberi factor, has the role of protecting the nervous system, but also can promote gastrointestinal peristalsis, improve appetite.

# Hazard of deficiency
1. Beriberi
A deficiency of vitamin B1 can lead to beriberi. Unlike beriberi, which is caused by fungal infections, this is a disease that damages the neurovascular system. Early symptoms are mild, mainly manifested as fatigue, apathy, poor appetite, nausea, depression, impatience, depression, heavy numbness of legs and feet, etc.
2. Encephalopathy
Chronic alcoholics are prone to alcoholism, causing vitamin B1 deficiency, leading to Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome. The disease is acute or subacute, clinical manifestations include insanity, ataxia, ocular paralysis, false memory and retrograde forgetfulness and even coma, is a neuroencephalic syndrome, also known as cerebral beriberi.

# Cause of deficiency
1. Insufficient intake
Vitamin B1 in food is lost or destroyed due to food shortage or lack of nutritional knowledge, improper food selection and improper cooking.
2. Absorption decreases
The decrease of intestinal function leads to the decrease of the absorption and utilization of vitamin B1, and liver and bile diseases lead to the decrease of biliary secretion and affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

# Recommended intake
The requirement of vitamin B1 in human body is closely related to energy metabolism in human body. The general reference intake of vitamin B1 should be calculated according to the total energy requirement.

The average adult requirement for vitamin B1 is 0.5 mg /4 186 kJ (about 1000 kcal). The recommended intake for special groups such as pregnant women, nursing mothers and the elderly is higher at 0.5-0.6 mg /4 186 kilojoules (about 1000 kcal).

Vitamin B1 is generally not toxic due to excessive intake. Only when the dosage is more than 100 times the recommended intake in a short period of time, headache, convulsion and arrhythmia may occur.

# Ingestion route
In daily diet, vitamin B1 mainly comes from cereals, mostly exists in the epidermis and germ of cereals. Rice, noodles processing too fine can cause a large amount of vitamin B1 loss.
Because vitamin B1 is soluble in water and easily decomposed by heat under alkaline conditions, excessive washing of rice or the addition of alkali in the cooking process can lead to a large amount of its loss. Loss of vitamin B1 in the process of steaming is not much, frying, barbecue and other high temperature cooking, the loss of vitamin B1 can reach 30% ~ 40%.
